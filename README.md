# Risk Optimization in Action

---
This is the repo for the paper “Risk optimization during ongoing movement: Insights from movement and gaze behavior in throwing” containing data and code used for the data analysis and visualisation. In three experiments, we examined sensorimotor behavior under risk in a VR throwing task. A video of a complete trial can be watched [here](https://tube.switch.ch/videos/x7ovZmTbEs).

## Experimental design in short

**Task**

- throwing balls into the green target circle (+100 points for every hit)
- 0 vs -500 (vs -2000) points when hitting the overlapping red penalty circle
- goal: collect as many points as possible across trials

**Conditions**

In the experiment, we manipulated:

- the costs of hitting the penalty circle: 0 vs -500 (vs -2000 in Exp3)
- the distance between the penalty and target circle: 30cm vs 45cm vs 60cm

**Main dependent variables**

- Location of final gaze fixation before throwing movement [final_fixation_shift_x]  as an indicator of their planned aimpoint  
- Location of ball at impact [Ball_impact_shift_x] as measure of their movement outcome
  
## The repo contains  

- [Analysis Code](./analysis_code): Jupyter Notebooks to run the analyses for Experiments 1-3 and generate figures
- [Data](./data): Data files for Experiment 1-3 prepared for analysis
- [Figures](./figures): Figures generated by running the Jupyter Notebooks
- [Monte Carlo Simulation](./monte_carlo_simulation): Python code to compute optimal shifts given (a) participants’ movement variance, (b) penalty-rewards and (c) distance between the circles
